Travel Budget Prediction System
Overview
The Travel Budget Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to estimate the cost of a trip based on various factors such as destination, duration, accommodation, transportation, and activities. This tool helps travelers plan their trips by providing an accurate budget estimate, considering both historical data and real-time pricing.
Features
Destination Analysis: Predicts the budget based on the selected destination (city, country, or region).
Customizable Trip Details: Users can input the duration of stay, type of accommodation, and group size.
Transport Cost Estimation: Incorporates the cost of flights, rental cars, or public transportation.
Seasonality and Trends: Adjusts predictions based on the travel season (peak or off-peak).
Activity Planning: Estimates costs for activities like sightseeing, tours, and events.
Real-Time Data Integration: Fetches real-time pricing data from APIs for up-to-date predictions.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Required libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Model Details
The travel budget prediction model uses a combination of regression techniques and real-time data fetching to provide accurate cost estimates. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of historical travel costs, adjusted for inflation, seasonality, and destination-specific factors.

Key Features:
Regression Models: Used to predict continuous variables like accommodation and transport costs.
Feature Engineering: Includes custom features like cost per day, cost per person, and seasonal adjustments.
API Integration: Fetches real-time pricing data for flights, hotels, and activities.
Data Sources
Historical Data: Sample datasets from previous trips.
Real-Time Pricing: Integrated through travel APIs like Skyscanner, TripAdvisor, and Kayak.
Economic Data: Consideration of inflation and currency exchange rates.
